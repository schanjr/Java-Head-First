1.There are two way to declare generic accept types:
public <T extends Animal> void takeThing(ArrayList<T> list)

does the same thing as 

public void takeThing(ArrayList<? extends Animal> list)



If they both do the same thing, why would you use one over the other?

public <T extends Animal> void takeThing(ArrayList<T> one, ArrayList<T> two)
instead of typing
public void takeThing(ArrayList<? extends Animal> one, ArrayList<? extends Animal> two)
