/*Abstract classes contains abstract methods. Abstract methods are expected to be extended(inherited) by other classes that will use it. 
This is a modelling feature in scenarios where you're certain some methods will exist in the child classes, but the implementation needs to 
be customized. For example there could be an abstract machine or plant, but the child class will define the method based on what kind of machine 
or plant it is. http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/faq/faq0084.html
