/*
 * 	In OOP, constructors are always inherited (invoked to be more exact) the moment they are instantiated.
	Objects that has a parent super class would also get the constructor invoked. Here are some general rules:
	1.super() is always invoked (in the background by the JVM)
	2.If super class has a multiple constructors, the one that has doesn't have arguments gets invoked.
